# stille Post

A fun, experimental project in Python that mimics the classic "Telephone" gameâ€”what happens when you translate the same text over and over? Watch as the meaning, tone, and style of your text evolve (or devolve) through multiple translations.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install flask openai
