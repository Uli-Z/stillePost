A fun, experimental project in Python that mimics the classic "Telephone" game—what happens when you translate the same text over and over? Watch as the meaning, tone, and style of your text evolve (or devolve) through multiple translations.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install flask openai
3. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
    On Windows: set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    On macOS/Linux: export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

## Run the project:

    python main.py

    Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

## Concept

Ever wondered what happens if you translate the same text repeatedly? This project is a playful experiment to explore that very question. As your text is translated over and over, subtle (or not so subtle) shifts in meaning emerge—just like in the game "Telephone". Enjoy the experiment and share the hilarious results!
